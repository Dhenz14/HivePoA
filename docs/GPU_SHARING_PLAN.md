# GPU Sharing Plan — HivePoA Compute Marketplace

## Status: PLAN v3 (protocol-hardened after second review)

**Goal:** Anyone with a GPU can contribute compute to the Hive-AI training pipeline and earn HBD. Bittensor-style economics, Hive-native — no separate token, no validator subnet, just HBD via the existing HivePoA treasury/contract system.

**Date:** 2026-03-16 (revised)
**Baseline:** HivePoA `v1.1.0` (sealed at tag `7f4ad10`). Post-release hardening at `a4158a9` (on main, not tagged). Hive-AI compute stack at current main.

> **Clarification:** `v1.1.0` is the sealed tag at `7f4ad10`. `a4158a9` is post-release hardening on main (advisory lock, SQLite parity). Any implementation branch should fork from `a4158a9` on main, not from the `v1.1.0` tag.

---

## What Already Exists (DO NOT REBUILD)

### HivePoA Server (TypeScript/Express)
- 20+ compute endpoints live at `/api/compute/*`
- Atomic job claiming via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
- Lease sweeper — cleans stale leases every 60s
- Node registration with GPU model, VRAM, supported workloads, cached models
- Job lifecycle: create → claim → start → progress → submit → verify → settle
- Three-stage payouts: budget held, verification, then settlement
- Warm-up reputation: new nodes start restricted (eval_sweep, benchmark_run only)
- 6 workload types defined: `eval_sweep`, `benchmark_run`, `adapter_validation`, `domain_lora_train`, `weakness_targeted_generation`, `data_generation`
- Only 2 implemented in the worker: `eval_sweep`, `benchmark_run`

### Hive-AI Worker (Python)
- `GPUWorker` class (413 lines) — registers, polls, claims, executes, heartbeats, submits
- `EvalSweepVerifier` + `BenchmarkRunVerifier` — server-side re-verification (15% tolerance)
- `HivePoAComputeClient` — full REST client for all compute endpoints
- `scripts/gpu_worker.py` — CLI entry point
- `scripts/canary_compute.py` — end-to-end canary with mock mode
- 17 tests covering contracts, worker, verifier, client

### Training/Eval Scripts (available, not all wired to worker)
- `scripts/regression_eval.py` — 60-probe domain eval (WIRED)
- `scripts/executable_eval.py` — code gen + sandbox (WIRED)
- `scripts/train_v5.py` — Unsloth + QLoRA on Qwen2.5-Coder-14B (NOT WIRED)
- `scripts/train_domain.py` — domain-specific LoRA training (NOT WIRED)
- `scripts/improve.py` — weakness-targeted pair generation (NOT WIRED)

## Revised Plan: 5 Phases

### Phase 0 — Artifact + Provenance Contract (PREREQUISITE)

**What:** A durable artifact layer that all subsequent workload types depend on. Content-addressed inputs/outputs, provenance metadata, size limits, hash verification.

**Why prerequisite:** Without this, data generation batches and adapter weights become an operational mess. You cannot verify, reproduce, or aggregate what you cannot reliably store, reference, and attribute.

**Components:**

**1. Artifact manifest schema** (added to every job result):
```json
{
  "provenance": {
    "job_id": "uuid",
    "job_nonce": "random-per-job (prevents replay across jobs)",
    "worker_version": "1.2.0",
    "worker_git_sha": "abc123",
    "base_model_sha256": "sha256:...",
    "tokenizer_sha256": "sha256:...",
    "dataset_cid": "QmAbCdEf...",
    "dataset_sha256": "sha256:...",
    "seed": 42,
    "hyperparameters": {"lr": 2e-4, "rank": 32, "epochs": 2},
    "runtime": {
      "cuda_version": "12.4",
      "torch_version": "2.4.0",
      "quantization": "4bit-bnb",
      "platform": "linux-x86_64"
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Artifact storage contract:**

- All outputs > 1 KB go to IPFS (CID is the canonical reference)
- Result JSON contains: `output_cid` (IPFS CID) + `output_sha256` + `output_size_bytes`
- Size limits per workload type:
  - `data_generation`: max 50 MB (JSONL batch)
  - `domain_lora_train`: max 500 MB (adapter tar.gz)
  - `eval_sweep` / `benchmark_run`: max 5 MB (result JSON)

**IPFS availability policy:**

- **Pinning responsibility:** Worker pins artifact to its local IPFS node and reports CID. Coordinator re-pins to its own node within the verification window. Verification cannot proceed until coordinator has retrieved the artifact.
- **Retrieval timeout:** Verifier has 5 minutes to fetch artifact by CID. If unretrievable, job is marked `verification_pending` (not failed). Coordinator retries 3x over 15 minutes. If still unavailable, job fails with `artifact_unavailable`.
- **Minimum replication:** Artifact must be retrievable from at least the worker's IPFS node during the verification window. After coordinator re-pins, 2 copies exist (worker + coordinator).
- **Retention:** Pinned for 30 days minimum. GC after 30 days unless referenced by an active adapter in the baseline registry.
- **Onboarding eligibility:** Workers are only eligible for artifact-producing workloads (`data_generation`, `domain_lora_train`) if the coordinator successfully fetches a test artifact from the worker during registration. Workers behind NAT without port forwarding must use a coordinator-managed ingress path (upload via HTTP to coordinator's IPFS node) instead of relying on direct IPFS serving.

> **v1 scope note:** The IPFS availability policy is a verification-window guarantee, not a durability guarantee. This is acceptable for v1 — the coordinator re-pins all verified artifacts.

**3. Replay prevention:**

- Every manifest includes a `job_nonce` (random, assigned by server at creation)
- Worker must echo `job_nonce` in result provenance
- **Scoped dedup rule:** `output_sha256` dedup is enforced per `(workload_type, artifact_class)`:
  - `data_generation` + `domain_lora_train`: reject cross-job identical artifacts (these should always be unique)
  - `eval_sweep` + `benchmark_run` + `adapter_validation`: allow identical results (deterministic jobs can honestly produce byte-identical outputs)
- The `job_nonce` echo is the primary anti-replay mechanism. Global hash dedup is a secondary defense, not a blanket ban.

**4. Capability matching (expanded beyond just VRAM):**
```json
{
  "min_vram_gb": 16,
  "min_disk_free_gb": 50,
  "required_cuda_major": 12,
  "required_base_model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct",
  "required_quantization": "4bit-bnb",
  "max_wall_clock_seconds": 7200,
  "generator_model_allowlist": ["qwen3:14b", "qwen3.5:9b"]
}
```

**Changes needed:**

| Repo | File | Change |
|------|------|--------|
| Hive-AI | `hiveai/compute/models.py` | Add `ProvenanceMetadata` dataclass, `ArtifactRef` dataclass |
| Hive-AI | `hiveai/compute/worker.py` | Collect provenance on every job execution, include in result |
| Hive-AI | `hiveai/dbc/compute_client.py` | Add `upload_artifact(path) → cid` using IPFS, `download_artifact(cid) → path` |
| HivePoA | `server/services/compute-service.ts` | Validate `job_nonce` echo, enforce `output_sha256` dedup across jobs |
| HivePoA | `server/routes.ts` | Add `job_nonce` to manifest on job creation |

**Acceptance test:**
1. Create eval_sweep job — manifest includes `job_nonce`
2. Worker submits result with provenance metadata + nonce echo
3. Server accepts
4. Same worker resubmits same `output_sha256` to a different job → rejected
5. Worker submits result with wrong `job_nonce` → rejected

---

### Phase 1 — Data Generation Jobs

**What:** Workers generate training pairs for weak domains. Embarrassingly parallel, no merge complexity.

**Workload type:** `data_generation`

**Generator model constraint:** Manifest specifies a `generator_model_allowlist`. Worker must use a model from the list. This prevents mixed-distribution dataset quality issues. Start with `["qwen3:14b", "qwen3.5:9b"]` — models the coordinator has tested.

**Verification (layered, not just sampling):**

| Check | Layer | Cost |
|-------|-------|------|
| JSONL schema validation | Structural | Cheap — parse every line |
| Required fields present | Structural | Cheap |
| Exact + near-duplicate detection (within batch) | Corpus | Medium — hash + trigram |
| Refusal/template boilerplate detection | Corpus | Cheap — pattern match |
| Repetition + length-distribution anomaly | Corpus | Cheap — stats |
| Domain keyword validator | Corpus | Cheap |
| Sampled quality scoring (10% via coordinator model) | Semantic | Expensive — LLM call |
| `job_nonce` echo + `output_sha256` dedup | Provenance | Cheap |

**Decision:** PASS if all structural/corpus checks pass AND sampled quality ≥ 70%.

**Manifest contract:**
```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "workload_type": "data_generation",
  "job_nonce": "server-assigned-random",
  "domain": "rust",
  "pair_count": 50,
  "generator_model_allowlist": ["qwen3:14b"],
  "server_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
  "quality_threshold": 0.7,
  "prompt_template": "weakness_targeted",
  "max_wall_clock_seconds": 1800
}
```

**Payout:** See revised economics below.

---

### Phase 1.5 — Adapter Validation as First-Class Path

**What:** Before training jobs, add `adapter_validation` — workers load an existing adapter and run hidden eval. This is cheaper than training and gives the coordinator confidence in worker capability before trusting them with expensive training jobs.

**Why here:** Warm-up reputation currently restricts new workers to eval_sweep/benchmark_run. Adding adapter_validation as the next reputation tier gates access to domain_lora_train. Workers prove they can load a base model + adapter before being trusted to train one.

**Flow:**
1. Coordinator uploads adapter to IPFS
2. Creates `adapter_validation` job with adapter CID + eval manifest
3. Worker downloads adapter, loads onto base model, runs quick eval
4. Submits scores
5. Verifier compares against coordinator's own eval of same adapter

---

### Phase 1.75 — Micro-Training Canary

**What:** Before full paid training, workers must pass a capped micro-training canary: 50-100 steps on a known shard. This catches OOMs, disk exhaustion, checkpoint corruption, and Unsloth/QLoRA compatibility issues that only appear under training load, not validation load.

**Flow:**
1. Coordinator creates `domain_lora_train` job with `max_steps: 100` and minimal budget
2. Worker trains 100 steps, submits adapter
3. Verifier loads adapter, runs quick eval
4. If PASS: worker reputation upgraded to "training-capable"
5. If FAIL: worker remains at adapter_validation tier

**Why not skip this:** A worker that can load an adapter and run inference (Phase 1.5) has proved inference compatibility, not sustained training stability. OOMs happen under backward pass, not forward pass.

---

### Phase 2 — Domain LoRA Training Jobs

**What:** Workers train domain-specific LoRA adapters and upload adapter weights.

**Workload type:** `domain_lora_train`

**Gating:** Workers must have reputation ≥ 5 (passed 5+ eval/validation jobs) AND passed a micro-training canary to claim full training jobs.

**Runtime pinning:** Manifest specifies exact runtime requirements:
```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "workload_type": "domain_lora_train",
  "job_nonce": "server-assigned",
  "domain": "rust",
  "base_model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct",
  "base_model_sha256": "sha256:...",
  "dataset_cid": "QmAbCdEf...",
  "dataset_sha256": "sha256:...",
  "epochs": 2,
  "learning_rate": 2e-4,
  "lora_rank": 32,
  "max_steps": 2000,
  "seed": 42,
  "quantization": "4bit-bnb",
  "min_vram_gb": 16,
  "eval_after_train": true,
  "max_wall_clock_seconds": 7200
}
```

**Verification:** Full hidden quick eval (18-probe), not sampled. Training jobs are higher value and lower count — full verification is justified.

**Adapter output must include:**
- `adapter_model.safetensors`
- `adapter_config.json`
- `training_log.json` (loss curve, lr schedule, wall time)
- Provenance metadata (all hashes, seed, hyperparams)

---

### Phase 3 — Adapter Aggregation

**Merge algorithm:**

> **Phase 3 is an experiment, not a trust anchor.** The merge algorithm is intentionally provisional. All publish decisions are subordinate to full eval and rollback capability. Dense-delta + SVD is the prototype; it will be replaced when Phase 4's residual-carry method is chosen.

**Phase 3 prototype:** Dense-delta + truncated SVD (simple, debuggable).
```python
# Reconstruct dense deltas, weighted average, compress back to rank
deltas = [adapter.B @ adapter.A for adapter in adapters]

# Weight by normalized improvement over baseline on target domain, NOT raw verifier score
# Raw score overweights adapters good on one hidden slice but broadly mediocre
improvements = [adapter.domain_score - baseline.domain_score for adapter in adapters]
weights = [clip(imp / max(improvements), 0.1, 2.0) for imp in improvements]
weights = normalize(weights)

merged_delta = sum(w * d for w, d in zip(weights, deltas))
U, S, Vh = svd(merged_delta)
new_B = U[:, :rank] @ diag(sqrt(S[:rank]))
new_A = diag(sqrt(S[:rank])) @ Vh[:rank, :]
```

**Known limitation:** Truncation back to rank 32 discards residual information every round. Monitor `discarded_residual_norm = ||merged_delta - new_B @ new_A||` to detect when compression is destructive.

**Phase 4 production:** Move to FedEx-LoRA residual-carry scheme (pushes residual into frozen base weights instead of discarding). Reference: arXiv 2410.09432.

**Admission control (do NOT merge every passing adapter):**

- Must pass hidden eval
- Must be non-dominated on at least one target domain
- Must not regress core baseline beyond threshold (3% on any domain)
- Merge set is curated, not mechanical

**Merge weighting:** Weight by **normalized improvement over baseline on the target domain**, clipped to [0.1, 2.0]. Do NOT use raw verifier score — it overweights adapters that are good on one hidden slice but broadly mediocre.

**Baseline registry (immutable):**

Every merged adapter version is recorded with:
```json
{
  "version": "v6",
  "parent_version": "v5",
  "merged_at": "2026-04-01T12:00:00Z",
  "contributing_job_ids": ["job-1", "job-2", "job-3"],
  "contributing_workers": ["worker-a", "worker-b"],
  "dataset_cids": ["QmAbc...", "QmDef..."],
  "merge_algorithm": "dense_delta_svd",
  "merge_rank": 32,
  "discarded_residual_norm": 0.023,
  "eval_scores": {"python": 0.94, "rust": 0.96, "go": 0.93, ...},
  "overall_score": 0.945,
  "baseline_improvement": 0.012,
  "adapter_cid": "QmMerged...",
  "adapter_sha256": "sha256:..."
}
```

This enables regression forensics: when a merged round regresses, you can trace exactly which datasets, workers, and verifier versions contributed.

**Round manifest:** Each aggregation round produces a round manifest that lists all inputs, all admission decisions (accepted/rejected + reason), merge weights, and output adapter reference. This is the audit trail for the merge.

**Registry storage (hybrid):** Keep the authoritative baseline registry off-chain in the coordinator DB for speed and queryability. Periodically anchor immutable snapshots to Hive via `custom_json` containing the registry root hash. This gives cheap operations plus an auditable timestamped anchor without forcing the full registry on-chain.

---

### Phase 4 — Multi-Round Federated Loop

**Do NOT start until:**
- Phase 0-2 have stable artifact handling and verifier telemetry
- 3+ reliable workers with established reputation
- Dataset ≥ 50k pairs
- Merge evaluation harness can detect regressions across rounds

**When ready:**
- Coordinator shards dataset, distributes to workers
- Workers train starting from current best adapter (not base model)
- Coordinator collects, curates, merges, evaluates, publishes if improved
- Re-shard each round (new random split for distribution balance)
- Track residual norm — switch to FedEx-LoRA when SVD truncation exceeds threshold

---

## Revised Economic Model

### The Pricing Reality

HBD ≈ $1 USD (Hive on-chain conversion mechanism). Cloud GPU rates (2026):
- RTX 4090: ~$0.34/hr
- A100: ~$1.19/hr
- H100: ~$1.99/hr

A 30-minute 4090 run costs ~$0.17 at cloud rates. The original plan's 0.05-0.10 HBD for a 30-120 minute training job was **below cost**.

### Revised Job Pricing

| Workload Type | Duration | Budget (HBD) | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| `eval_sweep` | 5-30 min | 0.010-0.050 | Low GPU, mostly inference |
| `benchmark_run` | 5-20 min | 0.010-0.050 | Low GPU, mostly inference |
| `data_generation` | 10-30 min | 0.030-0.100 | Medium GPU, inference-heavy |
| `adapter_validation` | 5-15 min | 0.010-0.030 | Load model + quick eval |
| `domain_lora_train` | 30-120 min | 0.200-0.500 | Full training, 16+ GB VRAM |

### Market Positioning

This is **not cloud-competitive pricing**. It is **surplus-idle-GPU participation**:
- Workers donate idle GPU cycles below cloud market rate
- In exchange: earn HBD (real cryptocurrency) for idle compute
- The appeal is passive income from hardware already owned, not competing with RunPod
- Compare to Folding@Home or early Bitcoin mining: under-market compute with non-monetary motivation (community, early participation, reputation)

### Pricing Formula (v1 — fixed posted prices)

Use fixed posted prices per workload type, not a formula. The market is too thin for dynamic pricing to be meaningful in v1.

```
payout = posted_price[workload_type]

posted_price = {
  eval_sweep:          0.020 HBD   (fixed)
  benchmark_run:       0.020 HBD   (fixed)
  data_generation:     0.050 HBD   (fixed, per 50-pair batch)
  adapter_validation:  0.020 HBD   (fixed)
  domain_lora_train:   0.300 HBD   (fixed, 16GB tier)
}
```

These are **below cloud market rate** by design (surplus-idle-GPU model). If the market proves too thin at these prices, raise them — do not add complexity with dynamic pricing until there are 10+ active workers.

Example: Training job on 16GB GPU = **0.300 HBD** (posted price, not computed).

> **v1 design choice:** Posted prices. No formula. Adjust by manual repricing when market feedback warrants it.

---

## Revised Security Model

### Trust Hierarchy (unchanged)

```
TRUSTED (coordinator): Job creation, verification, merging, payouts
UNTRUSTED (workers): Data gen, training, eval execution — all verified before payout
```

### Expanded Attack Mitigations

| Attack | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Worker submits fake scores | Full hidden eval re-run by verifier |
| Worker submits garbage adapter | Verifier loads adapter + full hidden eval |
| Worker replays previous good result to new job | `job_nonce` echo + `output_sha256` cross-job dedup |
| Worker submits plagiarized data | Exact + near-dedup against existing corpus |
| Worker submits poisoned training data | Whole-batch structural filters + sampled semantic review + canary probes |
| Hidden eval overfitting over time | Rotate hidden eval set periodically |
| Sybil attack | Warm-up reputation + Hive account age (7-day minimum from v1.0 security hardening) |
| Runtime drift (different quant/tokenizer) | Manifest pins exact model hash, quant backend, tokenizer hash |
| Resource fraud via slow heartbeating | Progress semantics per workload type (e.g., "step 500/2000") |
| Backdoor triggers in training data | Corpus-level anomaly scans + canary probes in merged adapter eval |

### Verification Throughput Policy

The verifier is an intentional bottleneck. This is acceptable in v1.

| Workload | Verification | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `domain_lora_train` | **Every submission** — full hidden eval | High value, low volume, must catch bad adapters before merge |
| `adapter_validation` | **Every submission** — full hidden eval | Gate for training access, must be reliable |
| `data_generation` | **Every submission** — layered structural + corpus + 10% semantic | Medium value, need whole-batch filters |
| `eval_sweep` | **Every submission for reputation < 10**, probabilistic audit (30%) after | Low value, high volume at scale |
| `benchmark_run` | Same as eval_sweep | Same economics |

Probabilistic audit is acceptable ONLY for low-value workloads AFTER workers have proven reputation. Never for training or data generation — those produce artifacts that enter the training pipeline.

### What We Deliberately Do Not Prevent

- Workers seeing training data (open public good)
- Workers copying adapters (public LoRA artifacts)
- Workers using cloud GPUs (compute is compute)

## Success Criteria

**Phase 0 complete when:** Every job result carries provenance, artifacts go to IPFS, replay is prevented.

**Phase 1 complete when:** Worker generates 50 pairs, passes layered verification, earns HBD.

**Phase 1.5 complete when:** Worker loads adapter + runs eval, result verified, reputation gates training access.

**Phase 2 complete when:** Worker trains LoRA adapter, passes full hidden eval, earns HBD.

**Phase 3 complete when:** 2+ adapters merge into a better adapter than any individual, residual norm tracked.

**Phase 4 complete when:** Automated multi-round loop with monotonic improvement. Cost target: < 2 HBD per prototype round (defined as 3-5 training jobs + verification overhead, NOT a universal ceiling).

## Review Questions for GPT (v3)

Previous review addressed:
- Phase 0 is now a hard prerequisite with schema examples (Q1 partially addressed — see below)
- Pricing is now fixed posted prices, not formula-based (Q4 resolved)
- Verification policy is explicit: every high-value, probabilistic only for low-value + proven workers (Q7 resolved)

Open questions:

1. **The provenance schema needs a machine-validatable contract.** The doc shows JSON examples but does not publish a versioned JSON Schema or Pydantic model. Implementors on the TypeScript and Python sides will drift without a shared schema file. Should this be a `schemas/provenance_v2.json` file validated on both sides, or a Pydantic model in Python with TypeScript types generated from it?
2. **Is the reputation ladder (eval → adapter_validation → micro-training canary → full training) too many gates?** Could we collapse adapter_validation and micro-training into one step?
3. **Is FedEx-LoRA the right residual-carry scheme for Phase 4?** Are there simpler alternatives that preserve residual without modifying frozen weights?
4. **What corpus-level anomaly scans are practical for detecting training data poisoning?** Specifically: n-gram trigger detection, embedding drift measurement, and canary probe design.
5. **Is the IPFS availability policy (5-min timeout, 3 retries, 2-copy minimum) too aggressive or too lenient?** What happens when workers are behind NAT without port forwarding?
6. **Should the baseline registry be on-chain (Hive custom_json) or off-chain (coordinator DB)?** On-chain is immutable but adds cost. Off-chain is free but requires trust in the coordinator.
7. **Is domain-improvement weighting for merge the right signal?** Or should we also factor in diversity (adapters that improve different domains weighted higher than redundant ones)?
